# Security Implementation Guide

This document explains the key security features implemented in the Library Management System.

## 1. User Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
- Tokens expire after 1 hour for security

## 2. Data Protection
- Book notes are encrypted using AES-256-CBC
- Each note has a unique encryption key
- Encryption keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Example of encryption process:
  ```javascript
  // Encrypting a note
  const encrypted = encrypt(noteText);
  // Decrypting a note
  const decrypted = decrypt(encryptedText);
  ```

## 3. Database Security
- All database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
- Example of safe query:
  ```javascript
  // Safe way
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
  const [user] = await db.query(query, [userId]);
  ```

## 4. Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated before processing
- Rules for validation:
  - Username: 3-30 characters, letters and numbers only
  - Email: Must be valid email format
  - Book data: Required fields and valid year range
  - Notes: Maximum length and allowed characters

## 5. API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS protection for API access
- Secure HTTP headers using Helmet.js
- All sensitive routes require authentication

## 6. Error Handling
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Proper error logging
- Secure error responses

## 7. Best Practices
- Regular security updates
- Code review process
- Secure deployment practices
- Monitoring for suspicious activity

## 8. Future Security Plans
- Two-factor authentication
- Enhanced rate limiting
- Automated security testing
- Regular security training
